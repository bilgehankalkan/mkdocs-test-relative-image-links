# Top-level

## Correct behaviour

### Relative path, file in same top-level folder

This relative reference should show up, and does

![image alt text](toplevel.png)

`![image alt text](toplevel.png)`

### Relative path, file in sub-level folder

This relative reference should show up, and does

![image alt text](subdir/sub.png)

`![image alt text](subdir/sub.png)`

## Sub-level test

[sub-level test](subdir/sub.md)
